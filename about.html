            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Booze Cluez, your ultimate guide to navigating the vibrant and diverse bars of San Francisco! Founded by a group of friends with a passion for exploration and, of course, a good drink, we're here to make your bar-hopping experience organized, fun, and unforgettable.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is simple: to have one (1) drink at every bar, restaurant, or pub in San Francisco that serves alcohol. Why? Because life's too short to drink at the same bar twice! We're all about discovering new places, meeting new people, and enjoying the rich tapestry of experiences that San Francisco's nightlife has to offer.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>                    
        <p><em>Booze Cluez</em> began as a labor of love, a strong desire to explore San Francisco, and just a tiny bit of an 
    alcohol problem.  It has been created to help you, an adult over 21 years of age and a lover of alcoholic beverages, 
    to navigate the bars of San Francisco in an organized, fun and, dare we say, productive way.</p>
